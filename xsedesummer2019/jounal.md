| Wednesday (6/19)  | no meeting due to class                                      | Looked at christians pre Processing script and worked on the pre processing script using pandas and numpy. still confused about what exactly the professor means by classification of the images.  christian and i will have questions |
| Thursday (6/20)   | Asked professor the questions me and christian had regarding the classification | finished my pre processing panda script, it works however it is taking way longer than it should. will work on improving it before i post it on the github. Christian taught me how to use Git and how to commit stuff. |
| Friday (6/21)     | Professor expects to some form of a trained model by monday  | finally finished with my pre processing script, removed the redundant code. however i still cannot run the script of tensor because i cannot import panda. will ask professor on monday |
| Sunday (6/23)     |                                                              | put my pre processing script on github. Tried to make a model however i do not understand how to implement the stuff from the book. Re read chapter 5, still confused |
| Monday (6/24)     |                                                              | not sure how to approach making the training model. not sure if we should randomly choose training data or should it be from each individual  class and it own test data. talked to christian about it and he said the professor said the first 8 images or so from each phenotype should be to train data, another couple for validation and the rest for test. |
| Tuesday (6/25)    | talked to professor about issues we faced and we tried to understand a few models found online along with the professor | didn't do much because i have a final tomorrow               |
| wednesday (6/26)  |                                                              | looked at christians model and tried to understand it, couldnt do much because i had a migraine. |
| thursday (6/27)   | talked                                                       | was trying to understand how to use a pre trained model, however i have a project due for my class that i thought was due tomorrow, so worked on that |
| friday (6/28)     | talked to the professor, he told us that we'll have to present what we've done so far on tuesday and reminded us about our end result which is to use a GAN to generate images that can trick the computer | watched videos on using pre trained models and worked on some examples |
| Monday (7/1)      |                                                              | read chapter 5 again from the book, formulated some questions |
| Tuesday (7/2)     | Had our presentation along with Dr. Yanling Liu's interns    | none                                                         |
| Wednesday (7/3)   | Had a chat with Dr. Liu regarding pre trained networks. He explained about the two parts- upper and bottom. bottom part is the convolution that collects features. upper is the actual classifier. | Tried to use christians model along iwth VGG16 from keras however realized christians network is only for 'Cardiomegaly' disease, so will have to train a new network again. |
| Thursday (7/4)    | no meeting, 4th of july                                      | no work, 4th of july                                         |
| Friday (7/05)     | no meeting, 4th of july                                      | out of town                                                  |
| Monday (07/08)    | We were talking about GANS but i lost connection.            | solid day of work, trained a new network with near 90% already and then used the VGG16 from keras as a pre trained network to transfer learning, still have to fine tune the network, will push the network on to github after fine tuning it tomorrow |
| Tuesday (07/09)   |                                                              | trying to fine tune the network however my connection keeps resetting and i am repeatedly wasting time training the network. <br />finally started fine tuning the network however it is taking way too long.<br />changed the epochs from 100 to 10 because it was too slow. |
| Wednesday (07/10) | talked to the professor about my network and discussed our future plans for the project. I decided to work of visualiztion after completing my Pretrained network and christian will work on producing high quality images. | Finally the fine tuning has finished however it seems like i messed up because the accuracy hasnt improved. Thankfully the professor will let me know where i went wrong tonight. until then i will try to work on some other pre trained networks. |
